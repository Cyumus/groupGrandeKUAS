Remember to get notes from the every test case and save programs’ source code, if you write it by yourself.

Case 1:

Hardware: At least 4 XBees connected to laptops/PCs
Software: X-CTU
How to test: The coordinator is at the laboratory. The most farthest XBee (end device) is connected to the laptop, and it is physically in the other end of the corridor of the laboratories. Between them there are two routers. The end device sends data through routers. The end device can’t connect directly to the coordinator. One router drops out of the network. The network should still be capable to transfer data. If not, research why it can’t and try configurate/program nodes to work properly.

Case 2:
Hardware: At least 4 XBees connected to laptops/PCs
Software: DIY
This test case is similar to the case 1, but X-CTU isn’t used. Instead of it, make data sending and receiving programs by yourselves, and test them. It they won’t work, fix them.

Case 3:
Hardware: At least 4 XBees connected to laptops/PCs
Software: DIY
Topology will be similar as previous cases, but this time there is only one router and two end devices. The second end device will join to the network while it is running already. End device should automatically join the network.

Case 4:
Every XBee is router except the coordinator. Test functionality. DIY programs, and sensor data is transferred through the network.
